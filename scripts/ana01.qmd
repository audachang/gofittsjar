## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
# Load necessary packages
require(tidyverse)

# Define the path to your .sd2 files
data_path <- "../"  # <- Replace this with your actual path

# List all .sd2 files
sd2_files <- list.files(path = data_path, pattern = "\\.sd2$", full.names = TRUE)

# Read and combine all .sd2 files
all_data <- map_dfr(sd2_files, read_csv, show_col_types = FALSE)

# Compute average TP(bps) per file
average_tp_per_file <- map_dbl(sd2_files, function(file) {
  data <- read_csv(file, show_col_types = FALSE)
  mean(data$`TP(bps)`, na.rm = TRUE)
})

# Print average TP(bps) per file
tp_summary <- tibble(
  File = basename(sd2_files),
  Avg_TP_bps = average_tp_per_file
)
print(tp_summary)

# Overall average TP(bps)
overall_avg_tp <- mean(all_data$`TP(bps)`, na.rm = TRUE)
cat("Overall average TP(bps):", overall_avg_tp, "\n")

# Plot histogram of TP(bps)
ggplot(all_data, aes(x = `TP(bps)`)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.5, color = "black", fill = "skyblue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = overall_avg_tp, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(
    title = "Histogram of Throughput (TP) in bps",
    x = "TP (bps)",
    y = "Frequency"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
